	/**	Wrapper class for accessing KerbalStats via reflection.
	 *
	 *	Removes the need to actually link against KerbalStats.dll.
	 *	Querying KerbalStats from a mod is very easy: include
	 *	KerbalStatsWrapper.cs in your project, change **ModName** in the
	 *	namespace to the name of your mod, and then call KerbalExt.Get() with
	 *	the ProtoCrewMember object representing the kerbal and the query
	 *	string.
	 *
	 *	KerbalStatsWrapper.cs has been writted such that there is no need to
	 *	link against KerbalStats.dll. If the dll is not present, then
	 *	KerbalExt.Get() will return **null** and log the issue.
	 *
	 *	\note KerbalStatsWrapper.cs is licensed using the GNU Lesser General
	 *	Public License (as is the rest of KerbalStats). This means that mods
	 *	are free to use KerbalStatsWrapper.cs without worrying about their own
	 *	license so long as KerbalStatsWrapper.cs itself remains under the GNU
	 *	LGPL.
	 *
	 *	\note It seems some have a poor understanding of the GNU LGPL, so in
	 *	addition to the above, here is an explicit statement: you are free to
	 *	modify and use KerbalStatsWrapper.cs for any purpose on the sole
	 *	condition that KerbalStatsWrapper.cs itself, and any modifications you
	 *	have made to KerbalStatsWrapper.cs, remain free for others to modify
	 *	and use as they see fit. Your work remains yours to license as you see
	 *	fit.
